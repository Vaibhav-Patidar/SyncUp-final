SyncUp is a unified campus platform that makes student life smarter, more connected, and efficient.
It helps students collaborate in study groups, check teacher availability, and exchange help or tasks with peers — all within a single app.

🚀 Overview

On most campuses, students rely on multiple disconnected tools to study together, reach teachers, or get help with projects.
SyncUp bridges these gaps by connecting students, teachers, and peer networks into one seamless ecosystem.

Built for the hackathon “Hack the Campus — Innovate for Everyday Life,” this project aims to improve collaboration, communication, and productivity in everyday campus life.
